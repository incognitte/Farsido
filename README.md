# What is Farsido?

Farsido is a Farsi Unicode editor which can convert Vazhe Negar (and Iran System) to Unicode and vise versa. Farsido is based on Simredo which is a multi-lingual Unicode Editor. (For detailed information about Simredo visit Simredo Website) . In this site only new additions to Farsido that do not exist in Simredo are discussed. Farsido has an improved interface and keyboard for Persian users. In the future I will be adding a user interface in Farsi. Unicode is written in Java so it runs in Windows, Mac and Linux/Unix but if you do not have the Java runtime environment you should download it (for free) from here. Farsido was written by me to add Vazhe Negar conversion to Simredo and the source code is now available to the public under GPL and any changes made to the code must be made available to the public under a GPL license. Farsido was tested for over 2 years and I am not planing to do any furthur releases as I will not be using it.

# Key Features

* Simple Unicode Farsi editing in any system (Windows, Mac, Unix, Linux)
* Conversion between Unicode, Vazhe Negar and Iran System

# Requirements

Farsido is written in Java, thus you can run it on basically any system running Windows, Macintosh, Unix or Linux. However you must have the Java Runtime Environment which is available for free from http://java.sun.com . (Note: You should probably have the JRE installed on your system. If you could not run Farsido using run.bat then you should download and install the JRE.)

# Support

I have just made Farsido available to public so please send all your questions and bugs to farsido_AT_hoomanb-dot-com and I will post solutions here.

## General Questions

Q. Why is Farsido Free?
A. Farsido is released under GPL because I want it to be free, stay free and any changes made to it become available to the public for free.

Q. Where can I send donations?
A. Donations in any amount are greatly appreciated. Click here to donate using PayPal.

Q. What will be in the feature versions of Farsido?
A. I am currently working on fixing the bugs, a more user-friendly Persian interface and an online version of the program which you can use without downloading software, except the Java Run-time environment.

## Installation

Q. How to I install Farsido and Run it?
A. Download Farsido and open the zip file. There is no configuration required. You can double-click on Farsido.jar and if you have the JRE installed correctly the program will run. If did not run try run.bat and if it didn't work either you should download and install the Java Runtime Environment.

## Use

Q. Does Farsido 3.33 Release Candidate come with fonts?
A. No, but you can get many free fonts on the web. Click here for a detailed list.

## Conversion

Q. How can I convert to Unicode?
A. Save the original text is a normal text file (In Vazhe Negar you should chose "Generic" when saving) and then open that file with Farsido. When the Conversion dialog opens, choose the appropriate System. Now you can either use Save As to save the Unicode text or simply paste it in other programs. Farsido has many conversions but Farsi conversions (Vazhe Negar and Iran System) are at the top.

Q. How can I convert from Unicode?
A. Type or paste your text in Farsido and then click Save. When the Conversion dialog opens, choose the appropriate System. Farsido has many conversions but Farsi conversions (Vazhe Negar and Iran System) are at the top. You can open the file you saved with the appropriate program. Note: You will have problems when you open the resulting text file in Vazhe Negar. You should open the file separately it and paste it in Vazhe Negar.

Q. Why can't I convert bilingual text to and from Vazhe Negar?
A. Vazhe Negar has an incorrect system that has used English characters for Farsi characters and there is no way to figure which is which.
