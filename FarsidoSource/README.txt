Farsido 3
=========
Farsido is completely based on Simredo, a simple unicode text editor
written in Java and thus runs in any operating system.
The purpose of Farsido was to add Vazhe Negar conversion to Simredo.
I can no longer maintain Farsido and thus I release the source. The
code is very similar to Simredo as my only major contribution was
the conversion code.

Hope you find it useful!
